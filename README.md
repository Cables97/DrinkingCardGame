This project was made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

## How to Play

When the game loads, a deck of cards will sit on the bottom part of the screen. Clicking, or touching it with your finger will draw 3 cards face down.
Each card has a topic on the back, choose the topic you wish to do.
The card will flip, displaying the question, or task, and the penalty.
The deck will appear again on the bottom, the next player takes their turn.

Cards will not play again after they've been chosen.

## Breakdown  
### Purpose

I wanted to make a game that can played with friends at parties. 
It needed to be simple to play, so everyone can be included, but also entertaining enough to keep people's attention.


### Appearance

Most of the graphics were made using Bing AI Image generator, and heavily edited in Photo Shop.
All animations are based on CSS keyframe.

### Future Ideas
Player name input, along with a drink counter.
Options menu where the player can allow or disallow cards based on associated tags
Express and Socket.io to allow for players to play the game on their TV, and control it with their mobile devices. 
ChromeCast compatibility. 


please enjoy, and don't hesitate to reach out.
